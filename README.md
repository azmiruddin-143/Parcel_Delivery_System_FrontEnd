Project Overview
The Parcel Delivery System is a full-stack application built to manage a complete parcel delivery lifecycle. It serves three main types of users, each with a dedicated set of features:

Sender: Can book parcels, track their delivery status in real-time, and cancel a request if needed.

Receiver: Can view incoming parcels, confirm delivery, and track the status of their packages.

Admin: Has full control over the system, including managing all users and parcels, updating statuses, and monitoring overall operations.

The application's architecture is built on a robust backend and a modern, fully responsive frontend to ensure a seamless user experience.
